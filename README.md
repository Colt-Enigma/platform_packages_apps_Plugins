# POSP SystemUI Plugins used for ColtOS Project

This repository (currently) houses different SystemUI Volume Panel Plugins.
To build and use these as intended, you may need to pick some changes from our [frameworks/base](https://github.com/Colt-Enigma/platform_frameworks_base) and [packages/apps/ColtEnigma](https://github.com/Colt-Enigma/platform_packages_apps_ColtEnigma)

Then, compile the following modules:
```
CompactPanel
OreoPanel
TiledPanel
MiuiPanel
P404Panel
NezPanel
ShapeShiftPanel
```

**Please refrain from altering packagenames/classpaths and Copyright headers**
Respect original works :)

Special thanks to Alex (treydev) for the ViewTreeInspector animation trick!
